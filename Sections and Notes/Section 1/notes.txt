Syntax is how you write something
Semantics is what that something means

Syntax:
  if e1 then e2 else e3
  where if, then, and else are keywords and
  e1, e2 and e3 are subexpressions
  
Type-checking:
  first e1 must have type bool
  e2 and e3 can have any type (let's call it), but they must have the same typet
  the type of the entire expression is also t
  
Evaluation rules:
  first evaluate e1 to a value call it v1
  if it's true, evaluate e2 and that result is the whole expression's result
  else, evaluate e3 and that result is the whole expression's result
  
REPL - Read evaluate print loop (use expression)
CRTL + D > stop repl
CTRL + C and CTRL + S then you can type "use" again.

Recursion more powerful than loops
  - Loops often (not always) obscure simple, elegant solutions
  - solves simpler problems is less about of code
  
Evaluation:
1. eval the function
2. evalute the arguments
3. result is val of e in an environment
